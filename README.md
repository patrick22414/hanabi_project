## DQN
This is a (Dueling & Double) DQN implementation for the Hanabi game.

I'm not sure if it works yet because I don't have the hardware to train for 100M steps.

## PPO
Now there is a PPO implementation as well!

But it's definitely not working.

## Todo
- PPO
    - value function
    - GAE
    - RNN
- Project
    - logging
    - ad hoc evaluation
