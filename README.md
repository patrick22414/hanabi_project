# hanabi_project

## PPO
Now there is a PPO (with GAE) implementation as well!

And it's finally (kind of) working!

We now have a score of ~4/25 at 1M steps. Not good, but it's a start.

## DQN
There is a (Dueling & Double) DQN implementation for the Hanabi game.

But either DQN is too hard to train or it doesn't work at all.

## To-do

### PPO
- logging
- RNN
- ad hoc agents

### DQN
- priotized replay
- refactoring
